# Rainfall-Prediction-Using-Classification

The Project deals with current supervised learning models which are based on machine learning algorithm for Rainfall prediction.We have applied rainfall data to different machine learning algorithms and compare the accuracy of classifiers such as CatBoost, Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree,LSTM. Our motive is to get optimized results that provides a comparison of various evaluation metrics ofÂ  machine learning techniques and their reliability to predict rainfall by analyzing the weather data.

# Problem-Statement

Build an efficient Classification Model that should predict if there will be Rainfall.

# Dataset

We have used the Datset from Kaggle, Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package

# Preprocessing and Model Building

The File for Preprocessing and model building named "Rainfall Prediction Using Classification.ipynb" is uploaded here.
